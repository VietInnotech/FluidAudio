# Benchmarks

2024 MacBook Pro, 48GB Ram, M4 Pro, Tahoe 26.0

## Whisper Large v3 Turbo

Pre-built CoreML models from [argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml](https://huggingface.co/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml). Text normalization applied (lowercase, strip punctuation) before WER comparison.

```bash
swift run fluidaudiocli whisper-benchmark \
  --max-files 20 \
  --model-dir Models/whisperkit-coreml/openai_whisper-large-v3_turbo
```

```text
Dataset: LibriSpeech test-clean
Files: 20 (speaker 1089)
Average WER:  2.4%
Average RTFx: 3.4x
Median RTFx:  3.5x
Peak memory:  ~3.6 GB
```

RTFx is lower than Parakeet (~130×) because Whisper uses a large encoder-decoder with sequential KV-cache decoding. Accuracy is comparable: similar WER on clean speech, stronger on accented/multilingual audio.

### ASR Model Compilation

Core ML first-load compile times captured on iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 13 running the
parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-coreml bundle. Cold-start compilation happens the first time each Core ML model
is loaded; subsequent loads hit the cached binaries. Warm compile metrics were collected only on the
iPhone 16 Pro Max run, and only for models that were reloaded during the session.

## Text-to-Speech

We generated the same strings with to generate audio between 1s to ~300s in order to test the speed across a range of varying inputs on Pytorch CPU, MPS, and MLX pipeline, and compared it against the native Swift version with Core ML models.

Each pipeline warmed up the models by running through it once with pesudo inputs, and then comparing the raw inference time with the model already loaded. You can see that for the Core ML model, we traded lower memory and very slightly faster inference for longer initial warm-up.

Note that the Pytorch kokoro model in Pytorch has a memory leak issue: https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro/issues/152

The following tests were ran on M4 Pro, 48GB RAM, Macbook Pro. If you have another device, please do try replicating it as well!

## Voice Activity Detection

Model is nearly identical to the base model in terms of quality, performance wise we see an up to ~3.5x improvement compared to the silero Pytorch VAD model with the 256ms batch model (8 chunks of 32ms)

## Qwen3-ASR (Beta / In Progress)

Encoder-decoder ASR using Qwen3-ASR-0.6B converted to CoreML. Autoregressive generation with KV-cache.

> **Note:** WER/CER may be higher than the original PyTorch model due to CoreML conversion limitations. See FLEURS results below for full multilingual benchmarks.

Model: [FluidInference/qwen3-asr-0.6b-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/qwen3-asr-0.6b-coreml) (f32 variant)

Hardware: Apple M2, 2022, macOS 26

### LibriSpeech test-clean (2620 files)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| WER (Avg) | 4.4% |
| WER (Median) | 0.0% |
| RTFx | 2.8x |
| Per-token | ~75ms |

### AISHELL-1 Chinese (6920 files, 9.7h audio)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CER (Avg) | 6.6% |
| WER (Avg) | 10.3% |
| Median RTFx | 4.6x |
| Overall RTFx | 3.8x |
| Processing Time | 2.6h |

**Methodology notes:**
- CER (Character Error Rate) is the primary metric for Chinese ASR, as per the [Qwen3-ASR Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.21337v1): *"We use CER for character-based languages (e.g., Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and Korean) and WER for word-delimited languages"*
- WER calculation uses Apple's `NLTokenizer` for Chinese word segmentation; we were unable to verify how official Qwen3-ASR evaluation performs tokenization
- Official Qwen3-ASR reports 3.15% on AISHELL-2 (different dataset) per [HuggingFace model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B); our 6.6% CER on AISHELL-1 suggests some accuracy loss in CoreML conversion
- **Why AISHELL-1?** AISHELL-2 (1000h) requires an application with institutional affiliation and is restricted to non-commercial use. AISHELL-1 (178h) is openly available under Apache 2.0.
- Dataset: [AudioLLMs/aishell_1_zh_test](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AudioLLMs/aishell_1_zh_test)

```bash
# Run AISHELL-1 benchmark
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli qwen3-benchmark --dataset aishell
```

### FLEURS Multilingual (30 languages, ~70h audio)

Full benchmark across all 30 languages supported by Qwen3-ASR, matching the official FLEURS tiers.

**Which metric to use:**
- **CER** for character-based languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Cantonese) - WER is meaningless due to word segmentation differences
- **WER** for word-delimited languages (European, Arabic, etc.)

#### Results by FLEURS Tier

| Tier | Languages | Our CER | Official 0.6B WER |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| FLEURS (12 core) | en, zh, yue, ar, de, es, fr, it, ja, ko, pt, ru | **10.3%** | 10.0% |
| FLEURS† (8 add) | hi, id, ms, nl, pl, th, tr, vi | **20.9%** | 31.9% |
| FLEURS†† (10 hardest) | cs, da, el, fa, fi, fil, hu, mk, ro, sv | **41.0%** | 47.8% |

> **Note:** Official Qwen3-ASR reports WER, but for CJK languages this includes word segmentation artifacts. Our CER comparison shows CoreML conversion has minimal accuracy loss on core languages.

## Speaker Diarization

The offline version uses the community-1 model, the online version uses the legacy speaker-diarization-3.1 model.

### Offline diarization pipeline

For slightly ~1.2% worse DER we default to a higher step ratio segmentation duration than the baseline community-1 pipeline. This allows us to get nearly ~2x the speed (as expected because we're processing 1/2 of the embeddings). For highly critical use cases, one may should use step ratio = 0.1 and minSegmentDurationSeconds = 0.0

Running on the full voxconverse benchmark:

```bash
StepRatio = 0.2, minSegmentDurationSeconds= 1.0
Average DER: 15.07% | Median DER: 10.70% | Average JER: 39.40% | Median JER: 40.95% (collar=0.25s, ignoreOverlap=True)
Average RTFx: 122.06 (from 232 clips)
Completed. New results: 232, Skipped existing: 0, Total attempted: 232
Step Ratio 2, min duration 1.0


StepRatio = 0.1, minSegmentDurationSeconds= 0
Average DER: 13.89% | Median DER: 10.49% | Average JER: 42.84% | Median JER: 43.30% (collar=0.25s, ignoreOverlap=True)
Average RTFx: 64.75 (from 232 clips)
Completed. New results: 232, Skipped existing: 0, Total attempted: 232
Step Ratio 1, min duration 0 (edited) 
```

Note that the baseline pytorch version is ~11% DER, we lost some precision dropping down to fp16 precision in order to run most of the embedding model on neural engine. But as a result, we significantly out perform the baseline `mps` backend as well. the pyannote-community-1 on cpu is ~1.5-2 RTFx, on mps, it's ~20-25 RTFx.

### Streaming/online Diarization

This is more tricky and honestly a lot more fragile to clustering. Expect +10-15% worse DER for the streaming implementation. Only use this when you critically need realtime streaming speaker diarization. In most cases, offline is more than enough for most applications.

Running a near real-time diarization benchmark for 3s chunks, 1s overlap, and 0.85 clustering threshold:
```bash
swift run fluidaudiocli diarization-benchmark --mode streaming \
    --dataset ami-sdm \
    --threshold 0.85 \
    --auto-download \
    --chunk-seconds 3.0 \
    --overlap-seconds 1.0
